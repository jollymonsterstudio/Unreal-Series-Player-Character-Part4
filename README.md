* [Audio Resources - 03:38](https://youtu.be/i8QQdr0Lo_Y) - Finding free sounds using freesound.org

* [Import Audio - 11:55](https://youtu.be/i8QQdr0Lo_Y?t=712) - And finally importing them into Unreal for future use

Additionally here are a number of good resources for free music and sound ( as long as you include the correct copyrights )

* Free Sound - https://freesound.org/- collection of various amateur and professional sounds
* Soundbible - http://soundbible.com/royalty-free-sounds-1.html - another grouping of free sound effects
* Unreal Marketplace: Human Vocalizations - https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/human-vocalizations - a lot of questionable grunts
* 99Sounds - http://99sounds.org/free-sound-effects/ - tons of content from sound effects to music
